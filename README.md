# 🔐 PFE Resource Hub – AI & Security Anomaly Detection with NSL-KDD

This project is part of my **Final Year Project (PFE)** titled:

> **The Role of Linear Algebra in Artificial Intelligence – Application to Security Anomaly Detection Using the NSL-KDD Dataset**

## 🎯 Objective

To build an AI-based system that detects security anomalies (fraud) such as:
- DDoS (Denial of Service)
- R2L (Remote to Local)
- Probe (Surveillance and scanning)
- U2R (User to Root)

using the **NSL-KDD dataset** and machine learning algorithms like:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Stacking

## 🌐 About the Website

This repository powers an **interactive website** designed to organize and explore helpful resources gathered for the project.

### The site includes:
- 🎥 YouTube videos explaining concepts and implementations
- 📄 Research papers (both foundational and recent)
- 💻 GitHub repositories solving similar problems
- 📚 Courses and books on AI, linear algebra, and security
- 🛠️ Implementation guides and tutorials

Everything is categorized and filterable to help navigate the learning journey with ease.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `/resources` – The JSON file used to feed the interactive site
- `/public` or `/src` – Frontend interface to render the resource hub (if applicable)

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This hub bridges the gap between theory and implementation, showing how linear algebra supports AI models in solving real-world problems like cybersecurity threats.

## 🚀 Get Started

To run the site locally:

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedBelfellah/pfe-project-Resources.git
```

2. Open the project folder:
```bash
cd pfe-project-Resources
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
- Double-click on `index.html`, or
- Use a local development server like Live Server in VS Code:
  1. Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
  2. Right-click on `index.html`
  3. Select "Open with Live Server"

Note: Using a local server (like Live Server) is recommended to avoid CORS issues when loading the `resources.json` file.
